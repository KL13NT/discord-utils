# Contributing

Any contribution aimed at improving the performance or ease of use is of high priority.

The steps I go about this process is:

1. Open an issue that has a clear description of what you want, whether it be a bug fix or an improvement

2. If the issue is accepted and you want to modify/add the code yourself, open a PR after notifying me. else, it'll be left open until someone is assigned or a PR is made.

3. If you're opening a PR, make sure every commit you make is signed. See this to learn more about commit signing: [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works).
