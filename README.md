# Discord Utils

This is a collection of JavaScript/NodeJS utilities for discord bot development.

## Available Functionalities

To see function names either use `import/require` in your code (I have full types available) or simply inspect the `index.ts` file in `src`. A general classification can be:

- Moderation Utils: To mute, warn, and ban members.
- Object Utils: Helpers for when working with objects such as `GuildMember` or `TextChannel` objects.
- Embed Utils: Helpers for when creating embeds.
- General Utils: Parsers for different mention types and role handling.
